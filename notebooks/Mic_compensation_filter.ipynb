    "Note that the frequency response is almost flat between 400 Hz and 4000 KHz. See also that there is not more information about the frequency response for frequencys below to 100 Hz and above to 10 Khz. \n",

    "For now, we implement a IIR filter in order to compensate the microphone response at low frequencies."
